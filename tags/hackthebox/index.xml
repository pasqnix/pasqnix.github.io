    <description><![CDATA[As malware increasingly obfuscates itself and applies anti-analysis techniques to thwart our analysis, we need more sophisticated methods that allow us to raise that dark curtain designed to keep us out--binary analysis can help. The goal of all binary analysis is to determine (and possibly modify) the true properties of binary programs to understand what they really do, rather than what we think they should do. While reverse engineering and disassembly are critical first steps in many forms of binary analysis, there is much more to be learned.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[INTRODUCTION This path is composed of 6 boxes in a way that later boxes use information (like credentials) gathered from the previous ones. ▶ ARCHTYPE ◌ About =============
This is a Windows box where you can learn how enumeration can lead to RCE via SQL server queries.
 Machine : Archetype  Ip: 10.10.10.27  ◌ Enumeration =============
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.27
Ports 445 and 1433 are open, which are associated with file sharing (SMB) and SQL Server.]]></description>
